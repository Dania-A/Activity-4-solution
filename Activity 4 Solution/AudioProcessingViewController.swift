    //(This is solved on the storyboard)
    
    //TODO: Use StackViews and add buttons for different pitches in the correct way so they look like a grid of two columns (as in the provided screenshot)
    //(This is solved on the storyboard)
    
    //TODO: Add a tag for each of the pitch buttons, so you can use a single IBAction for all of them and differentiate the action to be taken using the tag. Please set the tag values equal to what you can see in ButtonTag enum below, so you don't need to change the code given to you here.
    //(This is solved on the storyboard)
    
    //TODO: Add the stop button to the storyboard using the correct constraints to have it look like the one in the screenshot.
